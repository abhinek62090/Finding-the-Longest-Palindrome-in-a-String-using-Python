# Finding-the-Longest-Palindrome-in-a-String-using-Python
This is a Python algorithm that takes string as input and finds the longest palindrome in the string. It does this by iterating over all possible substrings of the input string and checking if they are palindromes. The longest palindrome found is returned as the output.
